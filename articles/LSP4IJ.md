LSP4IJ is a new Free and Open-Source LSP client for JetBrains IDEs, compatible with both **community** and enterprise flavors.

It was originally a port of the [`Eclipse LSP4E`](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4e) project, as part of the [`Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/intellij-quarkus/) plugin, but has since then been extracted into a new standalone extension. In the process, the code has been partially rewritten to drastically improve stability, performance and developer experience.

It provides outstanding features such as: 
- The ability to configure LSP servers without developing a new plug-in (restricted to stdio-based connections for the moment).
- A set of API allowing third-party adopters to contribute LSP extensions to the JetBrains ecosystem
- a console view, allowing users to monitor and troubleshoot the communication between the IDE and the LSP servers.

The client already supports a significant amount of [features](https://github.com/redhat-developer/lsp4ij/blob/main/docs/LSPSupport.md) from the LSP 3.17 specification, and more are on their way.

If you found any bugs or can think of ideas for some great new features, please donâ€™t hesitate to head over to our Github repository and open a ticket.

## Installation
LSP4IJ requires at least Java 17 and Intellij 2023.2 at the moment.

The LSP4IJ plugin is available in the stable channel of the [JetBrains Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23257-lsp4ij).
